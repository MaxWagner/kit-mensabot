kit-mensabot
============

Twitterbot that tweets the daily canteen menu of the [KIT](http://kit.edu).  

It does little else than parse the [official menu](http://www.studentenwerk-karlsruhe.de/de/essen/?view=ok&STYLE=popup_plain&c=adenauerring&p=1) and tweet the contents via TTYtter. As such, it heavily relies on the html structure of that site and will break as soon as this is changed ever so slightly.

To see this thing in action, head on over to [twitter](http://twitter.com/MensaUniKA).
